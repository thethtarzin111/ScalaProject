# Renewable Energy Plant System

## Overview
Our REPS system generates power from renewable energy sources including solar panels, wind turbines, and hydropower.
It includes a control unit to monitor and control the renewable energy sources. The system also collects data from these sources and store them in a file.
Moreover, it displays the power plant's energy generation and storage capacity so that the operators can adjust the operations as needed.
Furthermore, the system also analyse data collected from these sources and filter the data by hourly, daily, weekly and monthly basis.
User can search the data by required date.

## Data Usage
Since this is just a MVP and a simulation, we decided to just make mockup data in a .csv file.
The future implementation would include getting real-time data from the APIs. 
However, due to tiem constraints, we simply showed the simulation via sample data.

## How to Use
Unlike usual Scala project where you run the main file, our project was built with build.sbt and command lines.
Therefore, in order to run the code, the user need to input the following in the terminal:
*sbt run*
Otherwise, the code will not run and the user will face some error.

## AI Declaration
This whole project has been built with the help of AI tools named Claude AI and ChatGPT for futher understanding of the project, the nature of REPS, the equations, the mockup data, idea generation and debugging.
